description: Cuisine is one of the three pillars that makes us El Padrino and we always make sure that from Tacos to Loaded Nachos, we do not cut corners, because we take pride in crafting fresh and flavourful Mexican meals that are not only delicious, but also healthy. We achieve this by sourcing ingredients from trusted local suppliers then combining these ingredients using tried and tested techniques to bring out the flavour of each and every item on our menu.
