Our Cuisine is what makes us El Padrino. We take pride in crafting fresh and flavourful Naija-Mexican meals. So, we do not cut corners,Â  we make sure every meal is not only delicious, but also healthy. We achieve this by sourcing ingredients from trusted local suppliers then combining these ingredients using tried and tested techniques to bring out the flavour of each and every item on our menu.
